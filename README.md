# sujit-devops-portfolio

This repository contains a **Java (Spring Boot) based portfolio application** that presents my professional background, experience, and DevOps expertise in a clean, structured, and web-accessible format.

This repository is intentionally kept **application-focused only** and does **not** contain CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure code, or Kubernetes manifests.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Provide a **self-hostable portfolio application**
- Showcase professional details, experience, and skill sets
